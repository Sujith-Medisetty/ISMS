Make sure that you install node, Angular, Java17, Spring tools in your local machine.
install nodeJS  https://nodejs.org/en/download
install angular  https://angular.io/guide/setup-local
install STS or VScode and set up environment STS link https://spring.io/tools.. but my preference is to use VSCode.. It is very much fluid than STS.

For material designs and UI packages make sure that you install angualr material via npm https://v5.material.angular.io/guide/getting-started
we need to install this after installing angular and also install FormsModule and HTTP modeules in angular these are external dependencies.

NOTE: (also used few other angular ui packages to make the ui fluid)
If any other dependencies are at the time of executing the application with command ng serve, angular will show the packages that are missing and asks us to install on our local machine. 


Run angular application using the below command
ng serve --ssl true --ssl-key localhost.key --ssl-cert localhost.crt

Coming to spring application try to open the spring boot application in vscode/STS(Spring tool suite). These I
DE's will help to execute this MAVEN project easily
